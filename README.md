Toggle Class in 4D

A 4D implementation of toggle functionnality. This can be compiled into a component or simply incorporated into your v18.R5+ code to allow you to use it.

Setting up
You have to add the QS_toggle class in your code and use 2 variables:
- button{n}
- container{n}

Both numbers must be aligned to let the toggle class work correctly.
